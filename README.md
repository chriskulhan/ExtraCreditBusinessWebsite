# ExtraCreditBusinessWebsite
This is a test website so I can see if what my group has planned for our capstone website will work.

It's essential you are install the correct dependencies and are in the correct place when running them.

#1: make sure you are in the flask_business_site directory in terminal:
cd flask_business_site

#2: create a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv

#3: activate the environment:
source venv/bin/activate

#4 install flask:
pip install flask
#also need to install the upgrade:
pip install --upgrade pip

#5: now you can run the app.py that should show the site:
python app.py
